Records the daily attendance of each individual.

- **Rent Records Sheet** <br/>
Calculates the rent allotment based on actuall number of people present on each month. <br/><br/>

  Technically the rent should be shared equally by each individual regardless of the number of stay.
  Since this sheet will not count an individual if it is marked as ``EXCLUDED`` for the whole month, it can be used for a flexible setup for transient housemates that are not part of the original contract.
